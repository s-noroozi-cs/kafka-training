     kafka MirrorMaker tool

        v1
            The previous Kafka MirrorMaker had a lot of inherent limitations, 
                
                * No guarantee of ordering of data inside a partition partitions, 
                
                * exact topic configs 
                
                $ So the replicated kafka topic was not an exact replica of the source topic.

        v2

            Some of the highlights design are:

                * Leverages the Kafka Connect framework and ecosystem.

                * Includes both source and sink connectors.

                * Includes a high-level driver that manages connectors in a dedicated cluster.

                * Detects new topics, partitions.

                * Automatically syncs topic configuration between clusters.

                * Manages downstream topic ACL.

                * Supports "active/active" cluster pairs, as well as any number of active clusters.

                * Supports cross-datacenter replication, aggregation, and other complex topologies.

                * Emits offsets required to migrate consumers between clusters.

                * Tooling for offset translation.

                * No data or partition rebalancing. gurantees ordering within partition
